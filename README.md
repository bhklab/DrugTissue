# TissueDrug

load CTRPv2, CCLE, GDSC, and gCSI

run GSEA_with_AUC.R to get enrichment scores in one matrix

all figures should run independently (Ctrl - A, run) , although venn diagram generation doesnt seem to wipe the previous figure and just superimposes it

lines need to be added to write to pdf automatically 

to generate the circos plot export the edges matrix generated at the end of "cytoscape edges.R" and import into cytoscape
